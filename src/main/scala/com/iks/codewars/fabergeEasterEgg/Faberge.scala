// One man (lets call him Eulampy) has a collection of some almost identical FabergÃ¨ eggs.
// One day his friend Tempter said to him:
//
//    Do you see that skyscraper? And can you tell me a maximal floor that if you drop your egg from will not crack it?
//    No, - said Eulampy.
//    But if you give me N eggs, - says Tempter - I'l tell you an answer.
//    Deal - said Eulampy. But I have one requirement before we start this: if I will see more than M falls of egg,
//    my heart will be crushed instead of egg. So you have only M trys to throw eggs. Would you tell me an exact
//    floor with this limitation?
//
// Task
// Your task is to help Tempter - write a function
//
//    height :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
//    height n m = -- see text
//
// that takes 2 arguments - the number of eggs n and the number of tries m -
// you should calculate maximum scy scrapper height (in floors), in which it is guaranteed to find an
// exactly maximal floor from which that an egg won't crack it.
//
// Which means,
//
// 1. You can throw an egg from a specific floor every try
// 2. Every egg has the same, certain durability - if they're thrown from a certain floor or below, they won't crack.
//    Otherwise they crack.
// 3. You have n eggs and m tries
// 4. What is the maximum height, such that you can always determine which floor the target floor is when the
//    target floor can be any floor between 1 to this maximum height?
//
// Examples
//    height 0 14 = 0
//    height 2 0  = 0
//    height 2 14 = 105
//    height 7 20 = 137979
//
// Data range
//    n <= 20000
//    m <= 20000
